# Change: Rewrite Shaoyong Yixue Page with Modern UI and Dark Theme

## Why
The current Shaoyong Yixue page has outdated styling that doesn't follow modern UI/UX principles. The tab navigation and banner components lack visual appeal and proper dark theme support. This change will modernize the UI, improve accessibility, implement a cohesive dark theme, and enhance the overall user experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## What Changes
- Redesign tab navigation with modern styling and smooth transitions
- Update banner components with enhanced visual design
- Implement comprehensive dark theme support
- Apply Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Optimize for mobile responsiveness
- Improve accessibility with proper contrast ratios
- Add smooth animations and transitions for better UX
- Update color scheme to align with modern design standards

## Impact
- Affected specs: shaoyong-ui capability
- Affected code: src/components/shaoyong/ShaoyongYixue.js, related CSS files
- Breaking changes: Visual appearance will change significantly (but functionality remains the same)
