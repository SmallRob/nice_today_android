# Change: Optimize Tiebanshenshu Calculation Results Display and Enhance Clause Interpretation Module

## Why
The current Tiebanshenshu calculation results display is not user-friendly and lacks detailed information about the calculation process. The clause extraction and interpretation module needs enhancement to provide more comprehensive and accurate interpretations. This change will improve user experience by making the calculation results more understandable and the interpretations more meaningful.

## What Changes
- Redesign the calculation results display with improved visual hierarchy
- Add detailed step-by-step calculation breakdown
- Enhance clause extraction with better filtering and categorization
- Improve interpretation module with more comprehensive analysis
- Add visual indicators for calculation accuracy and confidence
- Implement better error handling and user feedback
- Add export functionality for calculation results
- Enhance search capabilities within extracted clauses

## Impact
- Affected specs: tieban-display capability
- Affected code: src/components/shaoyong/TiebanshenshuCalculation.jsx, src/components/shaoyong/ClauseDisplay.jsx
- Breaking changes: Visual appearance will change significantly (but functionality remains the same)
