# Change: Refactor LifestyleGuide Game with Modern UI, Mobile Optimization, and Enhanced Gameplay

## Why
The current LifestyleGuide game (Life Matrix) has outdated UI that lacks mobile responsiveness and modern design principles. The game mechanics could be enhanced to provide a more engaging experience for users seeking to find meaning in their lives. This change will modernize the UI with Tailwind CSS, optimize for mobile devices, implement a cohesive dark theme, and enhance gameplay mechanics to make the experience more meaningful and accessible.

## What Changes
- Modernize UI with Tailwind CSS and responsive design patterns
- Implement comprehensive mobile-first responsive design
- Add dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- Enhance gameplay with new energy mechanics and progress tracking
- Improve accessibility with proper contrast ratios and ARIA attributes
- Add smooth animations and transitions for better UX
- Implement gamification elements to encourage meaningful engagement
- Add social sharing and export features for life insights
- Optimize performance with lazy loading and code splitting
- Add tutorial/onboarding flow for new users
- Introduce new meaningful dimensions and energy imprint types

## Impact
- Affected specs: lifestyle-guide capability
- Affected code: src/pages/LifestyleGuide.js, src/components/lifeStyleGride/*, src/utils/lifeGridStorage.js, src/utils/matrixData.js
- Breaking changes: Visual appearance will change significantly (but core functionality remains the same)
